# Narrative Overview

Coming Soon ...

# Campaign Structure

_The Serra Caerulea Conflict_ is a narrative campaign comprising of a mass engagement within the fridges of Galactic space during the Horus Heresy. We'll be using the _Bitter Conquest_ Campaign system for Games Workshop's **Warhammer: The Horus Heresy** (2^nd^ Edition). This system has been adapted from and inspired by the following publications: _Crusade_ (Warhammer 40,000 | 9^th^ Edition Narrative Play); _Conquest_ (_The Horus Heresy Book 4: Conquest_, pg. 166-237 ); and _Blood in the Void_ (The Horus Heresy Book 3: Extermination, pg. 184-197).

Rather than focusing on hosting our Campaign at a singular location on specific days, we are embracing an asynchronous form of play. This opens up the narrative to a wider breath of participants and allow flexibility in scheduling.

A Player (herein referred to as a _Commander_) wishing to participate in the Campaign must:

- Have access to a [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/) in order to utilize core [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) functionalities. 
- Prepare a minimum of one _Battle Company_ using the _Regimental Registry_ with a _Supply Limit_ of 1750 Points.
  - To easily allow for tracking your army and coordination with the _Event Organizer_, we require all Commanders to use the **modified _Crusade Roster_ Google Sheet** ([CLICK HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16BCPO0KQLAuUYAGdp5InqGLLtwZDTIiygZj8hFZoBTY/edit?usp=sharing)) created by [The Beard Bunker](http://www.thebeardbunker.com/2020/09/40K-crusade-roster.html).
  - See the [**Publications and Expansions** Section](#publications-and-expansion) for army creation restrictions.
- Join their local Gaming Community's Online Portal which is affiliated with the Campaign for regular updates:
  - **Western Pennsylvania** ~ [The Fabricators' Forge](https://discord.gg/fabricatorsforge)
  - **Northern West Virginia** ~ [NWV Warhammer Community](https://discord.gg/uX4PzTzgUK)
  - **Eastern/Central Ohio** ~ [Ohio 30K Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/620791115079114)
  - **Greater Appalachia** ~ _#pa_30k_ on [The Remembrancers' Retreat](https://discord.gg/8TMFkZWmjF)
- Register with the _Event Organizer_ (Joe Glaser, [_Astra Appalachia_](https://astra-appalachia.carrd.co/)) via the [Registration Form found here](https://forms.gle/vawBZEE4QTwchSkr9). 
  - For every additional Battle Company, a Commander must resubmit this Registration Form.

Please note, the Campaign is designed to be inclusive of all Commanders regardless of where they are stationed in Greater Appalachia, hence our _Play-When-And-Where-You-Can_ Asynchronous narrative structure. We ask that if Commanders take to the field at their Friendly Local Gaming Store (FLGS), to please ensure that you patronize the location, either through a regular membership or day-of hobby supplies purchase.

The Campaign will span the course of 2023 with story progression occurring in two week _Cycles_. The first of these will span from **January 13th** (Friday) till **January 28th** (Wednesday). This allows for a 2 Day resting period before the next Cycle begins. 

Each Cycle will contain a number of different _Conflict Zones_; a collection of _Missions_ specifically designed to enhance the narrative play experience and reward strategic creativity/adaption. Commanders will coordinate between themselves during the Cycle to engage in **up to two Conflict Zone Missions per _Battle Company_**. A Commander may continue to engage in Conflict Zones after this limit to facilitate, but gain no benefits from doing so; this attempts to level the playing field for all participants regardless of gaming schedules. 

If a Commander is **unable to coordinate an engagement** in one of the Conflict Zones during a Cycle, they may still attempt to advance their Battle Company through a **guided narrative adventure hosted by the Event Organizer**. Commanders must select a narrative Objective/Agenda in which they will, through asynchronous written narrative attempt to succeed in their mission (in the vein of classic text-based adventure games). To request this accommodation, please contact the Event Organizer via one of the affiliated Communities linked above. The Deadline for requesting this method of advancement is the **Second Saturday of each Cycle**.

The following rulesets require the Commander to discuss forming their Battle Force with the Event Organizer before Registering. This is mostly due to the fact that unlike the above "core" armies which are known to have participated significantly throughout the Horus Heresy, these factions are only rumored to have had any major impact on the course of events (at least according to surviving Imperial Records):
