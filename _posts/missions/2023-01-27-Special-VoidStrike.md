*"A dozen Legionaries fell to take that tower, and twice that number were grievously wounded. But take it we did, and in doing so, secured not only it, but a sector, a city, a peninsular and, at great length, an entire world."*

## The Armies

For this mission, all Commanders should compose an *Engagement Force* from their *Battle Company's Regimental Registry*, adding any additional *Conscripts* to their armies from the list of approved Horus Heresy publications provided by the Event Organizer (EO). The total points cost of the Engagement Force should not exceed 1,000 Points.

## The Battlefield

The playable area is defined as a 3' x 3' square area, or a total of 9 square feet in a custom orientation. The interior of the vessel is a tangled labyrinth of passageways and chambers, and should be represented appropriately. If you are using Game Workshop's _Zone Mortalis Complex_ terrain boards, then they may be laid out in an agreed fashion or, alternatively, the players may take turns placing tiles and walls so that they take up the playing area, making sure that each table edge has at least one clear entry/exit point per player.

## Deployment (The High Ground)

Before the game begins, both sides should divide their forces into two roughly equal forces based on their number of units. 

They must then decide which of these two forces is to be their spearhead and which of these two forces is to be their reserve. This arrangement represents the spearhead of an attacking force working its way through the vessel, and the defenders rallying to meet them. 

The gaming table is then divided into four bands as shown on the diagram opposite. The Attacking player chooses either Deployment Zone 1 or Deployment Zone 4 as their Deployment Zone. Before they deploy their force, the Attacking player may swap around the Zone Mortalis tiles in this zone should they wish, representing them choosing a target area for their breaching operation. The Attacking player then deploys their spearhead force anywhere in the deployment zone they have chosen. 

The other player then rolls a D6. On a roll of a 4+, they may choose any of the three remaining areas in which to deploy their spearhead, otherwise they must deploy their spearhead in the deployment zone on the opposite table edge to that chosen by their opponent. 

When the Attacking side's reserves become available, they enter play from the Attacker's table edge. The Defending side's reserves arrive from any other table edge.

## Special Rules

Zone Mortalis, Reserves


## First Turn

The Attacker has the first turn; their opponent, the Defender, may attempt to *Seize the Initiative*.

## Game Length

After five turns, roll a D6. On a 4+, a sixth and final turn is played.

**"Wipe Out!":** Regardless of any other condition, if at the end of the game your enemy has no units left on the table then you are victorious!

## Victory Conditions

The _Void Strike_ Mission represents the most perilous phase of a boarding assault for the attacker- the attempt to establish a foothold on the enemy vessel from which to press forward towards its most vital areas.  At the end of the game, the Commander who has scored the most Victory Points has won the engagement. If the Commanders have the same number of Victory Points, the game ends in a draw.

### Primary Objectives

At the end of the game, each player receives 1 Victory Point for each enemy Unit that has been completely destroyed. Units that are Falling Back at the end of the game and Units that are not on the board at the end of the game count as destroyed for the purposes of this mission. Remember that Independent Characters are individual Units and award Victory points if they are destroyed. 

In addition, each side gains a Victory point for each Units with the Line subtype that ends the game entirely within the opposing side's Deployment Zone and is not Falling Back. At the end of the game, whoever has the highest score is the winner. 

### Secondary Objectives

- Slay the Warlord
- First Blood

### Fruits of Victory

If the Victorious Player is in control of the Headquarters and Tighten the Noose is not in effect, speak with the EO regarding the type of Headquarters being held for a unique reward. If the Victorious Player is **NOT** in control of the Headquarters, they may select two Units from their Engagement Force to be *Marked for Greatness* instead of one.

**Mission Debriefs:** After you finish playing the above mission, ensure that one of the Commanders logs it in our system via the following Google form: [https://forms.gle/gFNQJEq2UKnNqBV58](https://forms.gle/gFNQJEq2UKnNqBV58).
