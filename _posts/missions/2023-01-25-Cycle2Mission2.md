## The Armies

For this mission, all Commanders should compose an *Engagement Force* from their *Battle Company's Regimental Registry*, adding any additional *Conscripts* to their armies from the list of approved Horus Heresy publications provided by the Event Organizer (EO). The total points cost of the Engagement Force can be played at any scale agreed upon by the Commanders, though it may not exceed 1,500 Points (or whatever maximum is set by the mission itself).

Commanders should either mutually agree -OR- roll off to see which side will be the "Attackers" and which side will be the "Defenders".

## Plan of Action

The time has come to take the conflict directly to the enemy's doorstep! This mission comprises of Commanders deciding one of two courses of action. They may either:
  - Conduct a _Boarding Assault_ game series against the Defender's Escort Frigate (see below)
  - Conduct a [_Killing Blow_](/Bitter-Conquest/Blood-in-the-Void/KillingBlow) against one of the Defender's Cruisers.

**Designer's Note:** Regardless of the number of _Engagements_ (aka, games) played during the above choice, a Commander may only be awarded RP from the _Fruits of Victory_ listed below. However, they do gain XP as normal from each _Engagement_ they participate in as normal. Additionally, this _Mission_ counts for one of the two per Cycle permitted, regardless of how many _Engagements_ take place.

Commanders should remember to submit one [Mission Debrief]((https://forms.gle/gFNQJEq2UKnNqBV58)) for each _Engagement_ undertaken, based on the choice above. 

All missions will played will have the following rulesets active for the full duration:
  - Zone Mortalis core ruleset ([found here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WQDUWdgltW9QsNQEVFkxYnxluOtCZ7vw/view?usp=share_link))
  - [_Blood in the Void_](/Bitter-Conquest/Blood-in-the-Void) Expansion

### Target: Escort Frigate
When conducting a "Hit & Run" against an escort-sized warship, three Boarding Assault missions are played:
- **Mission 1:** [_Void Strike_](/Bitter-Conquest/Blood-in-the-Void/VoidStrike)
- **Mission 2:** [_Wrecking Mission_](/Bitter-Conquest/Blood-in-the-Void/Wrecker)
  - Roll a D6 for the Mission Goal ...
    - Result of 1-2 --> _Drives_
    - Result of 3 --> _Augur Arrays_
    - Result of 4 --> _Weapon Batteries_
    - Result of 5 --> _Life Sustainers_
    - Result of 6 --> _Ship's Bridge_
- **Mission 3:** [_Salvation_](/Bitter-Conquest/Blood-in-the-Void/Salvation)

## Fruits of Victory
Due to the extremely variable nature of outcomes from this mission, the _Fruits of Victory_ vary dramatically. However, to honour the time commitment which is required for such actions, each player is awarded 5 RP for completing the _Boarding Assault_, with the overall Victor able to pick a result the Generic _Fruits of Victory_ table.

If the players instead decide to take part in the _Killing Blow_ mission, both players are awarded 2 RP for completing the mission, with the overall Victor able to roll on the Generic _Fruits of Victory_ table.

## Toll of the Void
Should the Attackers cause the ship to explode by having the most _Boarding Points_ OR by being victorious during the _Killing Blow_ mission, the Defender loses one of their fleet's ships. In doing so, they lose a number of RP equal to the difference in summed total Victory Points across all games played to determine the ship's fate. If this would cause the Commander to go into the negative, they must first enter the positive before spending
