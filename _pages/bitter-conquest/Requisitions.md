The following are a general collection of possible Requests that Commanders may spend RP in order to gain access to at the start of a Chapter. Event Organizers may elect to add special Requisition Requests (which may have extra requirements) at any time in order to further expand the narrative of the Campaign.

## Increase Supply Limit (1 RP)

Increase the Crusade Force's Supply Limit by 100 points.

## Access the Armoury (1 RP)

Select a Unit from your Battle Company. The Unit may then select one option from their Fleet's Armoury, making note of the upgrade on the Unit's Roster Card. Coordinate with the Campaign's Event Organizer for a list of possible selections which fit your Battle Company's narrative.

## Birth of a Warlord (1 RP)

Select one model with the Character Sub-Type from a Unit within your Battle Company. If available to the Character, they may gain one Warlord Trait (either from Published sources or Campaign Expansions) which they then mark on their Roster Card. This Warlord Trait is permanent. This Warlord Trait must be one which is available to the Character based on its Faction and Special Rules. A Character model may receive an additional Warlord Trait through this action, but it must choose only one Trait to employ when fielded as a Engagement Force's Warlord. This Warlord Trait is permanent and cannot be removed by any means.

## Fresh Recruits (1 RP for Infantry, 2 RP for Others)

Select one Unit from your Battle Company which has not achieved the Rank of Grizzled or higher. Add any number of additional models to this Unit (up to the maximum listed on its Unit Entry) and increase its points accordingly. Note that this cannot cause the Battle Company to exceed its Supply Limit.

## Beseech the Wisdom of the Ancients (2 RP)

Select one model with the Character Sub-Type from a Unit within your Battle Company. That Character may gain one **Advanced Skill** from the list provided by your Campaign's Event Organizer. 

## Field Promotion (2 RP)

Select a Unit from your Battle Company which has at least achieved the Blooded Rank and has a model with the Character Sub-Type. The Character may be upgraded to the next higher level of their type, if one is available, inheriting the new profile but keeping the previous options. For example, a Legion Consul may be upgraded to a have a Legion Praetor's base profile, but keeps their specialty. Likewise, a Legionnaire Tactical Sargent may be promoted to a Legion Centurion's profile, but remains within his Tactical Squad. Consult with your Campaign's Event Organizer regarding any questions that may arise. Every time a model is promoted in this way, increase its Crusade Points by 2.

## Armament Refitting (1 RP)

Select one Character which has been upgraded via the *Field Promotion* Requisition Request. That model may elect to swap its Minimum Wargear with that of its new Rank's Entry. Doing so increases that Unit's Crusade Points by 1 for each piece of Wargear swapped in this manner.

## Repair and Recuperate (2 RP)

Select one Unit from within your Battle Company that has one or more Battle Scars. Select one of that Unit's Battle Scars and remove it from the Roster Card, ensuring to also remove the -1 modifier to their Crusade Points. 

## Rearm and Resupply (1 RP)

Unlike other Requisitions, this Order may be purchased at any time. Select one Unit from your Regimental Registry that has a Roster Card. You can change any Wargear Options that models in that unit are equipped with as described on that unitâ€™s profile. You cannot replace a Weapon that a model is equipped with if the Weapon in question has been upgraded by a Weapon Enhancement/Battle Honor/etc.

**Designer's Note:** Remember, you may always pay for the Optional Wargear when you first create a Unit's Roster Card. If you do so, treat it as an additional points cost for the Unit (adding to the Unit's total) for the purposes of determining if you are under your Supply Limit. You may never exceed your Supply Limit for any reason.

## Even in Death I Still Serve (2 RP)

Unlike other Requisitions, this Order may be purchased at the Death of a Character -OR- at the beginning of a Chapter. Select a Character which has been removed from the Campaign as a **Fatality*. This Character may be returned to service within a Dreadnought Chassis, replacing its Stat Profile, all Wargear, and any Default Special Rules with that of any of the following base units depending on the Character's Nature:

  - Astartes Character Options:
