# Introduction
*The Sierra Caerulea Conflict* is a narrative campaign comprising of a mass engagement within the fridges of Galactic space during the Horus Heresy. We'll be using the *Bitter Conquest* Campaign system for Games Workshop's **Warhammer: The Horus Heresy** (Second Edition). This system has been adapted from and inspired by the following publications: _Crusade_ (Warhammer 40,000, Ninth Edition Narrative Play); *Conquest* (*The Horus Heresy Book 4: Conquest*, pg. 166-237 ); and *Blood in the Void* (The Horus Heresy Book 3: Extermination, pg. 184-197).

Rather than focusing on hosting our Campaign at a singular location on specific days, we are embracing an asynchronous form of play. This opens up the narrative to a wider breath of participants and allow flexibility in scheduling.

Please note, the Campaign is designed to be inclusive of all Players (herein referred to as a *Commanders*) regardless of where they are stationed in Greater Appalachia, hence our _Play-When-And-Where-You-Can_ Asynchronous narrative structure. We ask that if Commanders take to the field at their Friendly Local Gaming Store (FLGS), to please ensure that you patronize the location, either through a regular membership or day-of hobby supplies purchase.

# Campaign Progression

The Campaign will span the course of 2023 with story progression occurring in two week _Cycles_. The first of these will span from **January 13th** (Friday) till **January 28th** (Wednesday). This allows for a 2 Day resting period before the next Cycle begins. 

Each Cycle will contain a number of different _Conflict Zones_; a collection of _Missions_ specifically designed to enhance the narrative play experience and reward strategic creativity/adaption. Commanders will coordinate between themselves during the Cycle to engage in **up to two Conflict Zone Missions per _Battle Company_**. A Commander may continue to engage in Conflict Zones after this limit to facilitate, but gain no benefits from doing so; this attempts to level the playing field for all participants regardless of gaming schedules. 

If a Commander is **unable to coordinate an engagement** in one of the Conflict Zones during a Cycle, they may still attempt to advance their Battle Company through a **guided narrative adventure hosted by the Event Organizer**. Commanders must select a narrative Objective/Agenda in which they will, through asynchronous written narrative attempt to succeed in their mission (in the vein of classic text-based adventure games). To request this accommodation, please contact the Event Organizer via one of the affiliated Communities linked above. The Deadline for requesting this method of advancement is the **Second Saturday of each Cycle**.

Cycles will be grouped into _Chapters_, consisting of between 1-3 Cycles. At the start of each Chapter, there will be a Campaign-Wide Supply Limit Increase. This will also be the time when Commanders may spend Requisition Points to upgrade their armies (learn more about this process [here](/Bitter-Conquest#requisitions)). The schedule for the first half of 2023 is as follows:

  - **Chapter 1** (_Jan 13th - Feb 22nd_): 2000pt Supply Limit
    - **Ch. 1.1** (_Jan 13th - Jan 25th_): 1750pt Game Maximum
    - **Ch. 1.2** (_Jan 27th - Feb 8th_): 1750pt Game Maximum
    - **Ch. 1.3** (_Feb 10th - Feb 22nd_): 2000pt Game Maximum

# Publications and Expansions

Commanders may construct their armies using our list of pre-approved publications and expansions, both official and community-maintained. [You can find our constantly updated list here.](/Tools#approved-publications-for-all-events)

In the spirit of the mysteries surrounding the Nebula, the following rulesets are also open for play. However, they do require the Commander to discuss forming their Battle Force with the Event Organizer before registering. This is mostly due to the fact that unlike the above "core" armies which are known to have participated significantly throughout the Horus Heresy, these factions are only rumored to have had any major impact on the course of events (at least according to surviving Imperial Records):
