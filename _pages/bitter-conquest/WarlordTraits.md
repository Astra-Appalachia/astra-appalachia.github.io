The following are additional Warlord Traits for games within the *Bitter Crusade* Campaign system. They are separated into *Groups* of six Traits based on an overarching commonality. If the Trait is restricted to a specific game-mode, it will be indicated in the name of the Group within square brackets.

## [Zone Mortalis] Void Defenders

| D6 Result | Name                     | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1         | Command Access           | At the beginning of the Movement phase, a single bulkhead door in the Warlord's line of sight may be opened or closed. The Warlord may not be engaged in an assault when this Trait is used. |
| 2         | Ship-Wide Alert          | So long as the Warlord is already in play at the start of the turn, the Defender may add +1 to the result of all Reserves rolls. |
| 3         | Dominus Lux, Dominus Nox | At the beginning of the Game Turn, the Warlord may elect to have Night Fighting special rule apply to any models who are attempting to draw Line of Sight to their Unit. Conversely, if Night Fighting is currently active, they may ignore its effects for the Game Turn for all units which their Unit can draw Line of Sight to. |
| 4         | Eidetic Memory           | The Warlord and their Unit has the *Move Through Cover* special rule. Additionally, the Warlord and their Unit may use their Jump Packs with no penalties. |
| 5         | Grav Repeller Access     | At the beginning of the Game Turn, the Controlling Player may declare that all surfaces within a 12" radius count as Difficult Terrain. If any area within this radius is already Difficult Terrain, it becomes Dangerous Terrain. |
| 6         | Purge Order              | Once per game, so long as the Warlord is in play, instead of rolling as normal on the *Catastrophic Damage* table, the controlling player may declare that the *Depressurization* result applies to everything within a 12" radius around a point of their choosing. |

## [Zone Mortalis] Void Ravagers

| D6 Result | Name                     | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1         | Tip of the Spear         | The Warlord and one Elite Unit chosen at the beginning of the Game gain the *Line* Subtype. |
| 2         | Ferocious Assault        | Any enemy who makes a Reaction when this Warlord and their Unit are within 12" must roll two D6 and discard the lowest result. On a 4+, the Reaction does not succeed but the Reaction Point is still expended as normal. |
| 3         | Master of Ordnance       | If the Warlord is in play, when a roll is made on the *Catastrophic Damage* table, the controlling player may add +1 or -1 from the result. |
| 4         | Teleport Assault Veteran | When entering play via *Deep Strike*, the Warlord and their Unit do not roll to *Scatter* and automatically pass all *Disordered Charge* tests for the Player Turn they arrive on. |
| 5         | Steady Presence          | The Warlord and all models within their Line of Sight are immune to the effects of the *Blind Panic* special rule. |
| 6         | Sixth Sense              | The Warlord and their Unit may avoid any and all damage effect caused by a *Catastrophic Damage* result by passing an *Initiative* test. If the test is failed, determine the damage as described for that result. |
