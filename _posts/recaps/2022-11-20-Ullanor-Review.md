*The following is an excerpt from the Frontline Gaming article on the event, which can be [read in full here!](https://frontlinegaming.org/2022/11/14/horus-heresy-ullanor-scenario-interview/)*

## What was your favorite moment from the event?
"Now that is a hard one given how long of an event it was! I mean, Horus missed turn 2 because he rolled a 1 on reserves, arriving via Deep Strike right near the Tower’s entrance in turn 3 like it was all part of the plan. Then there is Dorn being mortally wounded by Mag Uruk Da Overfiend (leading a horde of Boyz and Nobz) followed by Sigismund also getting bodied when said PrimOrk was at 1 hit point. Then of course, there’s the “Unlimited Grot Workz” list which featured 75 Grotz on a Knight’s base as a massive firing line. Then Valdor and the custodians took an “L” in melee to ensure Sangunius could break free from melee and join Horus in the Tower. Then there were two tables full of Iron Warriors which just sat back and did what Iron Warriors do best: shell heavy artillery from the other side of the board."

## Looking back on the event, what went better than you had hoped?
"Honestly, the fact that the four Ork players were able to keep up with the 10 Imperium players. I was extremely worried that we weren’t going be able to ensure we were running on time, but we ended up being able to finish 2 hours early with an extremely satisfied (albeit tired) group of folks!"

## If you could do it again, what would you change?
"I’d probably lower the number of points for each army and try to cast a wider net for Ork players to join us for the event. Several folks were interested in playing, but the 5K mandatory was a bit rough for some 40K Ork players to manifest unless they were collecting for years (and thus had fond memories of Warhammer’s style before 8th/9th edition’s shake up). Additionally, I’d make the Tower ZM game a bit more challenging. Given each Imperium player teleported a Primarch into the final battle (except Dorn … RIP), the stats for the bodyguards were … less than truly horrifying."
