# Introduction
*The Sierra Caerulea Conflict* is a narrative campaign comprising of a mass engagement within the fridges of Galactic space during the Horus Heresy. We'll be using the *Bitter Conquest* Campaign system for Games Workshop's **Warhammer: The Horus Heresy** (Second Edition). You can explore the system's rules [here](/Bitter-Conquest).

Rather than focusing on hosting our Campaign at a singular location on specific days, we are embracing an asynchronous form of play. This opens up the narrative to a wider breath of participants and allow flexibility in scheduling.

Please note, the Campaign is designed to be inclusive of all Players (herein referred to as a *Commanders*) regardless of where they are stationed in Greater Appalachia, hence our _Play-When-And-Where-You-Can_ Asynchronous narrative structure. We ask that if Commanders take to the field at their Friendly Local Gaming Store (FLGS), to please ensure that you patronize the location, either through a regular membership or day-of hobby supplies purchase.

# Campaign Progression

The Campaign will span the course of 2023 with story progression occurring in three week _Chapters_ followed by a one week _Break_. This change went into effect at the start of Chapter 2 on April 3rd, 2023.

Each Chapter will contain a number of different _Conflict Zones_; a collection of _Missions_ specifically designed to enhance the narrative play experience and reward strategic creativity/adaption. Commanders will coordinate between themselves during the Cycle to engage in these battles on their own time within a given Chapter.

Each Battle Company may only gain Requisition Points (RP) or Fruits of Victory (FoV) from **up to two Conflict Zone Missions per _Chapter_**. In addition, each Unit in a Battle Company may only gain Experience Points (XP) from up to two Conflict Zone Missions per _Chapter_.

**EO's Note**: This seperation should encourage Commanders to branch out with their Engagement Force's size and composition as the Campaign progresses by playing more games against others while ensuring their Battle Company remains mostly inline with their opponents.
{: .notice--primary}

If a Commander is **unable to coordinate any engagements** in one of the Conflict Zones during a Chapter, they may still attempt to advance their Battle Company through one of two following options:
  - Submit written prose of a fictious engagment/dialogue/etc regarding their Battle Company to the Event Organizer. They will be awarded 1 RP for every 500 words (the average length of a printed narrative's page). Any foes that are included which are controlled by another Campaign Commander must be approved by them beforehand.
  - Completely paint & photograph a Horus Heresy Unit/Model to "Parade" Standard, awarding 1 RP for every 200 Points (rounded to the nearest 100). Once RP has been awarded in this manner, the models are not eligible cannot earn this reward a second time.
Commanders may only submit ONE of each of the above options per game they have missed in a given Chapter. 

**EO's Note**: If the Commander has joined late or is returning from a hiatus, they may create entries to be submitted as per the rules above for each game they have missed (including those in previous Chapters). This must be done before the end of the current Chapter in which they have joined/returned.

At the start of each Chapter, there will be a Universal, Campaign-Wide Supply Limit Increase. This will also be the time when Commanders may spend Requisition Points to upgrade their armies (learn more about this process [here](Bitter-Conquest/Requisitions)). The schedule for the first half of 2023 is as follows:

  - **Chapter 1** (_Jan 13th - Feb 22nd_): 2000pt Supply Limit
    - Ch. 1.1 (Jan 13th - Jan 25th): 1750pt Game Maximum
    - Ch. 1.2 (Jan 27th - Feb 8th): 1750pt Game Maximum
    - Ch. 1.3 (Feb 10th - Feb 22nd): 2000pt Game Maximum
  - **Chapter 2** (_Apr 3rd - Apr 23th_): 2250pt Supply Limit
  - **Chapter 3** (_May 8th - May 28th_): 2750pt Supply Limit
  - **Chapter 4** (_Jun 5th - Jun 25st_): 3000pt Supply Limit

# Publications and Expansions

Commanders may construct their armies using our list of pre-approved publications and expansions, both official and community-maintained. [You can find our constantly updated list here.](/Tools#approved-publications-for-all-events)

In the spirit of the mysteries surrounding the Nebula, the following rulesets are also open for play. However, they do require the Commander to discuss forming their Battle Force with the Event Organizer before registering. This is mostly due to the fact that unlike the above "core" armies which are known to have participated significantly throughout the Horus Heresy, these factions are only rumored to have had any major impact on the course of events (at least according to surviving Imperial Records):
