## On Marches the Machinations of War
The various forces now committed to the Sierra Caerulea Nebula have made their presences known to each other. The race towards reaping the various treasures and mysteries of this barely compliant sub-sector on the Galactic Fringe has begun.

Now the harsh cold of the Void must make its presence known. For like the voyages of old moving between the various "island oasis" to find safe harbor, you must brave the interstellar distance as Warp travel within the Nebula is fraught with danger. While your fleets are mighty, be ever vigilant least your enemy strike from the shadows.
