>FROM CAPTAIN ERASTUS,
>14TH COMPANY OF THE IMPERIAL FISTS
>THE HAMMERS OR DORN
>
>My company conducted a raid during "The Arrival" against a company of Iron Warriors commanded >by the traitorous Master of Ordinance, Arbakka . The Hammers slogged through a veritable blood >bath of unending waves of traitors to victory. Despite the employment of heavy artillery, >terminators, and elite Tyrant terminators,  we could not be stopped. 
>
>Unfortunately, I was gravely wounded. I fear my initiative has suffered as a result of my >battle scar. However, after driving the heretics from the field of battle, I recovered a >mysterious artifact from nearby ruins they had been defending. The artifact seems to date back >to old night and it instilled Fear in the locals as I walked amongst them with it, but I could >not help but feel a sense of Adamantium Will as I carried it. 
>
>They claimed it was cursed so we executed them for their heresy. 
>
>This world will be brought into compliance.
