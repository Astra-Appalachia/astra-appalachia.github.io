The following is a list of example *Advanced Skill* Special Rules which may be earned by a Character through a variety of ways (such as taking the Requisition, *Beseech the Wisdom of the Ancients*). Each Advanced Skill is listed alongside their *CP Cost* which details how many Crusade Points must be added to the Character's Roster Card upon the Skills acquisition. There is no limit to the number of Advanced Skills which a Character may posses, but Players are warned that even the mightiest of Heroes / Villains will eventually fall to Bolter and Sword.
