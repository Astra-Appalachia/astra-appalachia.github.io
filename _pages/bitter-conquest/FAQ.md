The following are questions fielded by players during the 2023 Narrative Campaign, The Sierra Conflict. It is not an exhaustive list and will be updated frequently.

---

_"Should I roll on the Character Injury Tables if a fallen model with the Character Trait has no invested RP nor Artifacts equipped?"_

For such models, it is not required to do so. This also applies for Conscripts, which do not gain any XP at all and in effect "fizzle" into the background after the game. 

An example is a Tactical Squad's Sergeant. They may have not gained any additional gear/skills during the course of the campaign. As such, they can just be "left to their wounds" and have a unit member take their place, filling that empty space with a new recruit (no change with the mechanics, just a lore rationale).

---

_"Is there a limit for Advanced Skill allocation per Character?"_

No, but you run the risk of having too much invested in a single character! Remember, Death comes for us all in the end, even the great heroes of myth.

---

_"If a Unit is killed via the Sweeping Advance action in a combat w/ multiple units, does each victorious Unit that succeeds gain a "kill" for xp?"_

Yes, but only if the units are allowed to make a Sweeping Advance in the first place and have rolled a result qualifying as a victory over the retreating Unit.

---

_"Does both an Independent Character and the Unit they have joined count as getting a "kill" if any part of their Unit kills an enemy unit?"_

Yes.

---

_"Can I change equipment freely on a Unit?"_

No, you must spend RP at the beginning of a Chapter. However, a player may always elect to roll on the Generic "Fruits of Victory" table if they are the Victor of the Game instead of the narrative option presented in the Mission.

---

_"When can I spend my RP during a Chapter?"_

You may spend any RP that has been accrued at any time AFTER your last Game a Chapter and BEFORE your first game of the following Chapter.

---

_"Can the same unit be 'Marked for Greatness' twice if the mission reward allows for more than one Unit to be 'Marked for Greatness'?"_

No, you have to select different Units.

---

_"When do I decide which Units I am selecting for a Battle?"_

After the Mission is chosen, but before rolls are made for determining attacker/defender or raider/defender etc. Basically, don't try to tailor your list against specifically your opponent, but don't run a list that makes you automatically lose a Mission.

---

_"Do I have to determine all of my Supply Limit choices in Advance of a Chapter?"_

No. You may add new Units to a Roster at any time as long as your Roster stays under your Supply Limit. HOWEVER, once they are added, they can not be modified in any way except by spending RP before a Chapter. They may always be Retired, but any XP, Artifacts. or other Boons they have will be lost forever.

---

_"Does spending RP to add a Warlord Trait allow you to take more traits than normally allowed per game size?"_

No. You may buy additional Warlord Traits on a single model, BUT they can only activate it if the game size allows it.

---

_"Does adding a Warlord Trait allow a Warlord to take more than 1 option per game?"_

No, it allows them to switch them between games.

---

_"What is the workflow for Characters after a Battle?"_

1) Unit undergoes the *Taken Out Of Action* test if it has been completely removed from Battle.
2) If the character (aka Sgt or Embedded Independent Character) was removed as a casualty, they MUST roll on the Character Table, regardless of the TOoA test's result (as this only determines if they get XP for the Battle).

---

_"Are we supposed to indicate how many models are in the squad on the sheet?"_

Yes, add it somewhere on the sheet (such as Other Notes.) You can field less of them in a given Game, but never more. You can change this with "Fresh Recruits" requisition at the start of a Chapter.

An example: If you register a Vet Squad of 8, you can field 5-8 of them, but not 9-10 of them. 

---

_"What are Cycles and what are Chapters?"_

We will be using the following short hand a lot through the campaign: *Chapter A.B*, where *A* is the Chapter Number and *B* is the Cycle Number. A **NEW** Chapter begins when *A* goes up by one value (IE: Chapter 1.B --> Chapter 2.B). A **NEW** Cycle begins when *B* goes up by one value (IE: Chapter 1.1 --> Chapter 1.2).
