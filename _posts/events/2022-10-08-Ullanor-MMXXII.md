## Event Primer

The **Ullanor Cursade** is a narrative-lead event of epic proportions set in 000.M31 of the ***Warhammer: The Horus Heresy*** universe (find more information [here](https://thehorusheresy.com/)).

Warboss Overlord Urrlak Urruk calls the hordes of Greenskinz to their homeland, amassing in the largest Ork Empire and WAAAAGH Host the Galaxy has ever seen. The system's planets have fallen to the Might of Gork and the Kunnin' of Mork and now der be teef for da takin'. Muster with da Biggest Boss for he has a KUNNIN 'ND BRUTAL PLAN TA KRUMP DEM HUMMIES FOR GUD.

Meanwhile, the Emperor of Mankind and a collection of his Primarchs have gathered on the outer edge of the system, gathering what forces they have to strike like rolling thunder upon the masses of xenos filth. After 202 years since the Great Crusade began, here on Ullanor Prime the true might of the burgeoning Imperium is tested. Heed the call of the Emperor and join his Crusader Host for the Glory of the Imperial Truth!

This event will be one for the record books, folks. Bring your largest forces, be they **ORK** or **HUMAN** to do battle and make history. Over the course of the day, we go from space born boardings of Space Hulks to the very capital of the greatest Ork Empire to ever flourish in the Galaxy. By the end, one will be named **Warmaster**. Will it be you?

## Event Mechanics
The game board will be divided into connected **War Zones** (6' x 4'). Each player will be designated a specific War Zone to stage their army in at the beginning of the event. Any **Destroyer Weapons** or units with the **Artillery** Sub-Type may target units outside their War Zone as long as they are within the Range characteristic. Units may elect to **enter another War Zone only ONCE per Game Turn** and fall under the immediate control of that War Zone's player as an On-Going Reserves Detachment.

Each War Zone will have its own successive series of **Primary Mission Objectives** which will be assigned in secret to opposing forces, representing the chaotic fog of war.

Additionally, each War Zone will have the following **Secondary Objectives** in effect: *Slay the Warlord*, *First Blood*, *Last Man Standing*, *Linebreaker*, *Attrition*, and *Price of Failure*.

Finally, as a **Tertiary Objective**, for each model with the *Character* Sub-Type which is felled in a Challenge or by a model with the *Sniper* Special Rule, the opposing player will score 1 Victory Points.

To represent the pivotal fight between Horus and Urllak, in the **Central War Zone**, there will be a **Fortification** Denoting the entrance to Warboss Urllak's Fortress. When Imperial Units enter the Fortress, all Players may nominate **one Unit** and **one Independent Character** to be Teleported into the Fortress. While the larger Apocalypse game continues, these Units will form an ad-hoc army under the command of the relevant player of the **Central War Zone**. These armies will be transported to a single 6' x 4' Zone Mortalis board for the final confrontation.

## Army Composition Requirements
For the event, players should prepare an army totaling **5000 Point** following the __Crusade Force Organization Chart__.

Players are encouraged to bring __any valid Lord of War (LoW)__ unit to **append** to their Crusade Force. The LoW Choice must not must not exceed a cap of **1000 Points** and is treated as an additional detachment (for a maximum cap of 6000 points for a complete army).

All units currently available through the following sources may be used in a player's army list subject to requirements of their relevant factions:

By its very nature, this event focuses heavily on forging a narrative and immersive experience. As such, it is heavily preferred if models being fielded by players fit within the narrative and honor the time and commitment of their opponents.

It is **required** that all players "Slay the Grey," bringing only models which meet the Games Workshop **Battle-Ready or 3-Color-Minimum Standard** (clear acrylic bases are allowed if it is the player's preference). Remember, "Battle-Ready" is not "Parade-Ready", so don't stress yourself out over perfection!

## Awards, Trophies, & Prizes â€¦ Oh My!
At each Event, there will be four award categories to be claimed by attendees: **Best Painted Army**, **Best Narrative Fluff**, **Best Sportsmanship**, and a **special secret award**. These awards are meant to honor the skill, dedication, and attitude of a player along with their chosen force which took to the battlefield on that event. One award from each category will be awarded to a player from each faction (IE: One Ork and One Imperium Player will receive **Best Painted Army**, etc).

Additionally, each player who has **Pre-Registered by November 1st, 2022** will be awarded with an **Ullanor Crusade Ribbon Medal** made specifically to honor this event. Keep your eyes peeled on your email for details regarding this badge of participation in one of the most pivotal points in Warhammer History!
