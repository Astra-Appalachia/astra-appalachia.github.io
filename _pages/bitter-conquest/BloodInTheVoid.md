## Catastrophic Damage Table

| 2D6 Result | Name                | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2 - 4      | Stable              | Although the hull cracks and moans with the sounds of distant thunderous explosions filling the air, the effects are not strong enough to play a part in the Battle this Turn. |
| 5 - 7      | Power Surge         | The ship's energy systems go into violent spasm, blowing out lighting arrays and either plunging the area into darkness or flooding it with a blaze of blinding sparks.  If this result is rolled, then the *Night Fighting* special rule is in effect this turn. If they were already in effect, they no longer apply this turn. Additionally, if they are being used, bulkhead and airlock doors may either open or shut on their own on a D6 roll of 5+ (rolling once separately for each one. |
| 7 - 8      | Hull Quake          | The ship's hull bucks and shakes, causing the gravity field to fluctuate wildly.  For this Game Turn, all clear terrain is counted as Difficult Terrain, all Difficult Terrain is treated as Dangerous Terrain, and all Dangerous Terrain explodes (dealing a Strength 5 AP 5 [*Pinning, Rending* (6+)] Attack to all models within the Terrain feature). |
| 9 - 10     | Wildfire            | A series of secondary explosions brackets the area of the battle as conduits erupt into flames and areas of the deck plating collapse or are blown in.  The players roll off and the winner may place 2D6 Large Blast (5") templates anywhere on the table. Each explosion Scatters 3D6" from the target point. Any model caught under a template suffers a Strength 5 AP 5 [*Pinning, Rending* (6+)] attack. |
| 11         | Depressurization    | The players roll off and the Winner indicates an area of the board entirely bound by walls and/or door sections. Any doors in this area immediately close if they were open and the area becomes subject to the *Cold Void* special rule for the remainder of the game. Should any door bounding the area be opened or destroyed, the effect extends to the adjacent area as far as the next set of walls and doors, which themselves automatically shut. Needless to say, players will have to use common sense to define the exact extent of any areas that become subject to this special rule. |
| 12         | Structural Collapse | The hull screams and shudders before part of it catastrophically fails and breaks apart, either blasting out air and debris into the beyond or shattering around the unfortunate combatants. The players roll off and the Winner indicates a single Board Quadrant of their choice. All models with a Toughness value in the affected area suffer an immediate Strength 4 [*Rending (5+)*] hit, and models with an Armour Value (including  special terrain, and so on) suffer a glancing hit on 4+. In addition, the *Depressurization* effect described in the previous result comes into play. |
