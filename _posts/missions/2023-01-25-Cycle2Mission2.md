## The Armies

For this mission, all Commanders should compose an *Engagement Force* from their *Battle Company's Regimental Registry*, adding any additional *Conscripts* to their armies from the list of approved Horus Heresy publications provided by the Event Organizer (EO). The total points cost of the Engagement Force can be played at any scale agreed upon by the Commanders, though it may not exceed 1,500 Points (or whatever maximum is set by the mission itself).

Commanders should either mutually agree -OR- roll off to see which side will be the "Attackers" and which side will be the "Defenders".

## Plan of Action

The time has come to take the conflict to the enemy! This mission comprises of Commanders deciding one of two courses of action. They may either:
  - Conduct a _Boarding Assault_ game series against the Defender's [Escort Frigate](Bitter-Conquest/Blood-in-the-Void#target-escort-frigate)
  - Conduct a [_Killing Blow_](/Bitter-Conquest/Blood-in-the-Void/KillingBlow) against one of the Defender's Cruisers.

Commanders should proceed through the required missions; submitting [Mission Debrief]((https://forms.gle/gFNQJEq2UKnNqBV58)) reports after each one. You can find the collection of the above mentioned missions at the end of this article.

## Fruits of Victory
Due to the extremely variable nature of outcomes from this mission, the _Fruits of Victory_ vary dramatically. However, to honour the time commitment which is required for such actions, each player is awarded 5 RP for completing the _Boarding Assault_, with the overall Victor able to pick a result the Generic _Fruits of Victory_ table.

If the players instead decide to take part in the _Killing Blow_ mission, both players are awarded 2 RP for completing the mission, with the overall Victor able to roll on the Generic _Fruits of Victory_ table.

## Toll of the Void
Should the Attackers cause the ship to explode by having the most _Boarding Points_ OR by being victorious during the _Killing Blow_ mission, the Defender loses one of their fleet's ships. In doing so, they lose a number of RP equal to the difference in summed total Victory Points across all games played to determine the ship's fate. If this would cause the Commander to go into the negative, they must first enter the positive before spending
