"Are you sure, Paladin?" Arakiel Ezekos' voice boomed, despite the Contemptor speaking quietly.

"Yes Brother, a surprise to me as well," Malachai spoke back, still staring at the vox.  A message from Terra, supposedly from the Emperor himself.  The Paladin of the Hekatonystika turned to his friend, "This sets us on a course we were surely unprepared for."

"And surely in contention with even our battle brothers, the whole First," Arakiel had been the finest of Paladins before suffering a terrible injury at the hands of the Rangdon.  Now, forever entombed in the Contemptor Dreadnought suit. 

"It is a command from the Emperor," Malachai JadeSong said defiantly.  His unit, the Scythes of the Emperor, have been devoutly loyal to their father.  One of the first units established in the First Legion, they were seen as unit willing to do anything the Emperor required, often doing missions that their brothers found themselves incapable of doing.  Yet the Scythes were always victorious.  Malachai had been leader since the beginning.  His word, his actions, always the finest amongst the whole legion.  Though he began his service on Terra during the Unifcations Wars, even prior to the Lion taking control of the legion, as a Tactical Squad leader, his prowess quickly earned him advancement up the ranks.  Now, he found himself at the head of an entire unit, the Sythes of the Emperor.  And always at his side was his trusted friend, Arakiel.  Once accepted into the ranks of the Paladins of Hekatonystika, Malachai found himself surrounded by knowledge unseen.  And top of that knowledge, was a book his mentor wrote, beseeching the Emperor as not just the greatest of all humans, but a god, immortal and perpetual.

"It comes to us then Malachai, you know the Scythes stand with you," Arakiel said, carefully placing the now unpowered Gravis Fist upon Malachai's shoulder.

Malachai read the command again, "Most loyal of sons, Malachai.  I require this of you, take your unit to the Sierra Caerulea.  There, you will find only foes, both Loyal and Traitor alike.  Let none stand in your way.  There is an artifact there, required to win this war of the greatest heresy.  You believe me to be a god, and though I loathe that description, I understand your intent.  Perhaps my request will shake you of the devotion, though I doubt it.  It requires my whole being, defending Terra until the end.  Find this for me, help win this war."

"So be it, vox the The Resolve and distribute my orders to the men, we leave tonight at 2100," Malachai spoke.  The Emperor was a god, he knew it true, but even gods need their Scythes.

"Cyphus will be especially pleased," Arakiel's laughter echoed from the walls.
