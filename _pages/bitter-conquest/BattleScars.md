The following Roll Tables indicate the various types of *Battle Scars* a Character may earn as the result of being removed as a Casualty during a Campaign's Engagement.  Each table is labeled to indicate what Unit Type it applies to. Each Battle Scars that a Character has earns them -1 Crusade Point until it is removed from their Roster Card through a mechanic which does so. If a Character already has the result of the D6 roll, they must reroll until a non-duplicate Battle Scar is achieved. If the Character has all six Battle Scars and is required to roll on the chart again, the Character instead takes the Fatality result on the Causality Survival Table.

| 6         | Angered Machine Spirit | At the start of its Movement Phase, roll a D6. If the result is a 1, the Unit cannot move and can only fire Snap Shops with its Battle Weapons (Defensive Weapons can fire normally). If this Unit is a Flyer, instead of not moving, it moves the minimum distance allowed in a straight line. This effect lasts unit the Player's Next Turn. |

| 5         | Disgraced                | This Unit is treated as a *Fellow Warrior* by their own army, which means they do not benefit from their Warlord's Trait and cannot be targeted by *Friendly* effects such as Psychic Powers. |
| 6         | Mark of Shame            | This Unit cannot preform any Special Actions (such as securing objectives, manifesting Psychic Powers, etc) and cannot Score/Deny Victory Points in any fashion. |
