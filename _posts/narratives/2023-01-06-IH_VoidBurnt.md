PLANETFALL ACHIEVED; SECURE ESTABLISHMENT OF LANDING ZONE ACCOMPLISHED. 
NO MEANINGFUL LOSSES: IMMORTALS STAND; VENERABLES STAND; **I STAND.**

Enemy contact made shortly after arrival; raiding party of sorts; insignificant. 
Enemy armour dispatched with prejudice and casualties sustained of no measurable regard; 
damaged frater reconstituted and ready for further action. The Key has been recovered and 
is under my watch.
